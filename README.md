# Rehabilitation Biomechanics
This repository includes selected HW, a Seminar and the Final Project for the Rehabilitation Biomechanics course in the BME faculty at the Technoin. 

## Final Project
This project is based on the data collected in an experiment that was conducted in the Bio-robotics and Biomechanics Lab (BRML) at the Technion. The experiment included one female subject that walked back and forth on a fixed path with various speeds and different shoes. The path included a built-in force plate to measure the forces applied on the ground during a sample step, and a surrounding motion capture system to measure selected joint positions throughout the experiment. Additionally, the stress distribution in the foot a was measured using an insert.     
The data collected from the motion capture system included but not limited to the joints positions throughout the motion in each of the 16 trials. The data collected from the EMG devices included the surface EMG signals at different muscle positions
Based on the collected data, we conducted Gait analysis, sEMG signal processing and analysed the stance phases using GRF.   

## Seminar
We based the presentation on the paper "Intent Prediction Based on Biomechanical Coordination of EMG and Vision-Filtered Gaze for End-Point Control of an Arm Prosthesis" by Nili E. Krausz , Denys Lamotte , Iason Batzianoulis, Levi J. Hargrove , Silvestro Micera , and Aude Billard.
